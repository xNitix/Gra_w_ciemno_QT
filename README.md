# Gra_w_ciemno_QT

## Authors: Norbert Dziwak, Mateusz Bobula

## Used library: Qt
## We created a game modeled on the popular "Gra w ciemno" program. The game starts with selecting 5 envelopes out of 25, containing cash, virtual of course! :) 
## In the envelopes you can find various cash prizes, such as 100,000, 50,000, or 10,000, but you can also find -50% and -100%, which will reduce our winnings. We have to fight for each envelope by answering random questions from the C++ programming language. We can sell the envelopes we win by negotiating with the host.  When we decide to end the negotiation, we will find out how much we won!

# Game controls
## The game controls are very intuitive. we select envelopes by pressing them, then we make decisions by clicking the appropriate signed buttons.
